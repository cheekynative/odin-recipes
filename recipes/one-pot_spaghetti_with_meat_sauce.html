        <h2>One-pot spaghetti puts Italian sausage, pasta sauce, and noodles together for a dish you can have on the table in less than 45 minutes.</h2>

        <p1>It doesn't get much easier than this by cooking everything in one pot.</p1>

        <p2>Switch it up by using ground beef, chicken, or turkey along with any other of your favorite ingredients, such as sliced mushrooms.</p2>
